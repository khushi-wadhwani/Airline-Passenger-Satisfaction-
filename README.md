## Preprocessing

The dataset was preprocessed by filtering records based on **customer segment** to ensure focused analysis. Key variables such as customer attributes, transactional measures, and categorical identifiers were reviewed for data quality. Missing values across numerical variables (e.g., counts, totals, or performance metrics) were handled using a combination of row removal and imputation, depending on their impact on the analysis. Categorical fields were standardized to ensure consistency, and **aggregated metrics** (such as totals, averages, and segment-level summaries) were created to support higher-level analysis.

## Analysis

The analysis phase focused on **grouping and aggregating metrics** by customer segment and other categorical variables to compare behavior and performance across groups. Categorical variables were encoded and analyzed to support segmentation and trend identification. Exploratory visualizations, including **bar charts** (for category comparisons), **scatter plots** (to examine relationships between numerical variables), and **pie charts** (to show proportional distributions), were used to explore patterns in the data. Charts were annotated with labels and titles to improve readability and interpretability.

## Results

The results highlighted meaningful differences across customer segments, revealing variations in key metrics such as aggregated totals, averages, and distribution patterns. Visual and aggregated outputs made it easier to identify dominant segments, outliers, and relationships between variables. Overall, the project demonstrates how structured preprocessing and exploratory analysis can transform raw data into clear, actionable insights.
